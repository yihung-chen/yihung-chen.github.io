Thank you for visiting my website. <br>

I am a Ph.D student in Political Science at National Taiwan University (NTU). <br>

My primary research interests lie in election and democracy studies. I am particularly interested in political parties and how they influence the behaviors of elites and citizens and ultimately affect electoral outcomes

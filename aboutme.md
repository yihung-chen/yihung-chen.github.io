Thank you for visiting my website.

Yi-Hung Chen is a Ph.D student in Political Science at National Taiwan University (NTU). He holds a M.A. degree in Political Sicence from NTU and a B.A. degree in Political Economy from National Sun Yat-Sen University.

His primary research interests lie in election studies, democracy studies, Taiwanese Politics, and causal inference. 

His currently work investigates the reverse coattail effect, specifically how lower-level representatives influence the electoral outcomes of higher-level representatives. Relatedly, he is examining how political parties constrain the political ambition of these lower-level officials. More broadly, his research explores the formation of political elites, the interactions between political parties, elites, and voters, and voter perceptions of political elites. Methodologically, he employs various types of experiments and causal inference methods for observational data.
